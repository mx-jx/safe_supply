# Introduction {#sec-intro}

In response to a rapidly evolving unregulated drug supply, a continuum
of safe(r) access models - that facilitate access to a drug of known
composition as an alternative to illicit market sources - have been
rapidly up-scaled in different parts of the world. Approaches that have
been considered under the broad umbrella of safe(r) access models range
from highly structured and supervised medical trets (such as injectable
opioid agonist treatment), through to community driven models of drug
acquisition, regulation and distribution provided in the context of
civil disobedience. This session will be an interactive conversation
with people in the alcohol and other drug field about the readiness of
Australia for considering safe(r) access models and reflecting on the
evolving approaches taken locally and internationally to respond to an
increasingly toxic drug supply.

The session will start with an introduction to safe(r) access approaches
and background on an informally convened 'Safe(r) Supply Network' in
Australia, which began meeting in December 2022, covering a brief
history of the meetings and an overview of the discussion and issues
that have been canvassed by the network to date.

Next, panel members (people who participated in the network meetings)
will speak for 5 minutes each, providing a diverse range of perspectives
on the issues of safe(r) access and reflecting on their priorities in
progressing a conversation on safe(r) access in Australia. 3) Finally,
the session will end with an interactive discussion providing an
opportunity for attendees to ask questions, share their views and
discuss possibilities and considerations for safe(r) access in an
Australian context.

While developing this workshop we have generated a list of additional
resources that cover a range of topics related to safe(r) supply. This
resources are presented in @sec-resources below.

**Aim:**

The aim of the APSAD panel symposium is to:

1.  bring the Australasian alcohol and other drug field into an ongoing
    conversation on safe(r) access approaches for Australia.
2.  consider language and diverse perspectives relating to different
    access approaches
3.  provide the opportunity for a broader discussion of how different
    safe(r) access approaches might work in an Australian context, and
    next steps for the field. We have provided a list of resources
    relating to safe(r) supply below to accompany this panel symposium.

## Background {#sec-background}

In response to the overdose crisis in the United States and Canada, a
debate is emerging about providing a 'safer supply' to people who use
drugs. However, ambiguity about the term muddles discussions and could
stifle innovation.

Safe(r) supply is defined by the Canadian Association of People Who Use
Drugs (CAPUD) as:

> "Safe supply refers to a legal and regulated supply of drugs with
> mind/body altering properties that traditionally have been accessible
> only through the illicit drug market."

There is, however, debate around the term "safe" supply:

> There are some who argue that "safe" in the term safe supply is
> inappropriate and misleading because even legal drugs have risks
> associated with their use. It is true the word "safe" could be
> misconstrued, but most should recognize its meaning by the way it is
> being used and in comparison to unsafe drugs. Using an analogy, we can
> say that thrusting a hammer toward a nail in your hand is not
> inherently safe, but because hammering nails is legal we can easily
> access hammers and nails that are "safe" and learn how to use them in
> safe ways. It is in this sense that legal and regulated drugs are
> "safe" even though there is still risk of harm. With the quality of
> the substance assured, people who use drugs are in a far better
> position to confront the risks associated with drug use.

There is a growing debate about providing people who use drugs with a
drug of known composition instead of what is sold in unregulated
markets, often referred to as 'safe supply' or 'safer supply'. However,
these terms are used to describe a diverse set of interventions that are
delivered along a continuum of care, with different levels of evidence,
target populations, outcomes and regulatory involvement (see
@fig-table).

One approach to safe(r) supply involves offering medications to people
who use drugs as an alternative to drugs from an unregulated market.
While there is no widespread consensus on which substances and under
what conditions of use constitute safer supply versus more traditional
treatments (e.g. OAT). Is liquid methadone consumed at a clinic a form
of safer supply? What about diamorphine (heroin) or pharmaceutical-grade
methamphetamine?

Some medical approaches to safe(r) supply require supervision by a
health professional (e.g. supervised injectable heroin treatment), but
another approach implemented in parts of North America expands a range
of prescribed substances for people that are 'provided in a less
clinical and more flexible way' (i.e. with minimal or no supervision)
with the goal of preventing overdose from drugs found in the illegal
supply. For example, a clinic in Vancouver (Canada) allows registered
clients to purchase individual doses of pharmaceutical-grade fentanyl
that are priced competitively to opioids sold on the street.

Another approach is for a group of individuals to pool resources to
purchase illicit drugs, test them and then re-package (with a detailed
breakdown of the contents) and distribute them to people who . The Drug
User Liberation Front (DULF) in Vancouver has held at least five events
where they have distributed the tested and re-packaged drugs without
serious repercussions or response from law enforcement. In August 2022,
it was reported that a 'Cocaine, Heroin and Methamphetamine Compassion
Club and Fulfilment Centre' had been in operation in Vancouver for a
month, although the club was not authorized by the government and the
drugs were not sourced from a pharmaceutical company; they were
purchased from the dark web, tested and sold at cost.

for their community-regulated safe supply](figures/dulf.png){#fig-dulf}

Beyond the variation in substances, levels of supervision and provision,
discussions associating safer supply with drug legalization can create
additional ambiguity. For example it has been argued that providing
individuals currently using drugs is different from allowing people to
test and distribute illegally produced drugs, which is very different
from a legalization model that regulates drug sales to any adult.

Policy debates about reducing harms posed by the unregulated drug supply
and related social and health harms would be more productive if
participants recognized and described the particularities of
interventions instead of referring to them broadly as safer supply. Such
generalizations restrict any nuanced discussions about the available
policy options. In @fig-table, a framework to facilitate discussions
that was developed by @kilmer2023 highlights interventions sometimes
referred to as safer supply; these options are not necessarily mutually
exclusive. Traditional opioid agonist treatment (such as buprenorphine
and methadone), which is sometimes ultimately focused upon abstinence,
is not included in the list below, however, some people may consider
this safer supply.
